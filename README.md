# Weather Applet | Python GUI Application

A Python-based Weather Applet that retrieves and displays real-time weather information for user-specified cities using a public REST API. The project focuses on API integration, GUI development, and real-time data processing using Python.

This application allows users to enter a city name and instantly view live weather details such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions through a simple and interactive graphical interface.

Technologies used in this project include Python 3, Tkinter for GUI development, and the OpenWeatherMap REST API for fetching real-time weather data. The application uses the requests library to handle HTTP requests and JSON parsing to extract relevant weather parameters from API responses.

The Weather Applet supports city-based weather search and dynamically updates the interface based on user input. It also includes input validation and error handling mechanisms to manage invalid city names, incorrect API responses, and connectivity issues.

The overall workflow of the application follows a clean and structured approach where user input is taken through the Tkinter GUI, an API request is sent to the weather service, the JSON response is parsed, and the processed weather data is displayed back to the user.

To run this project locally, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, add your OpenWeatherMap API key inside the source code, and execute the Python file. The application runs on Python 3 and requires the requests library.

Project structure consists of the main Python source file for the weather application along with the README documentation and an optional requirements file.

This project demonstrates practical skills in REST API integration, GUI development, event-driven programming, JSON data handling, and software debugging.

Future improvements may include adding multi-day weather forecasts, automatic location detection, enhanced user interface design, weather icons, and packaging the application as a standalone desktop executable.
